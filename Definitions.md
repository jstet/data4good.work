## Fields

Organization on this list must apply methodologies from the following fields: 

**Data Analysis**: The process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information. Data Analysis is the process of examining data to extract insights and draw conclusions. It involves the use of statistical and mathematical techniques to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in data. Data Analysis is used to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. 

**Data Intelligence**: Data Intelligence is the process of presenting data in a way thatâ€™s meaningful to and interpretable by decision-makers and stakeholders. It involves collecting, storing, and processing data to extract useful information and insights. Data Intelligence is concerned with contextualizing and analyzing data to make it a more powerful, trustworthy, and informative tool for an organization. Data Intelligence is also about understanding and using data in the right way. A related concept is that of Business Intelligence. An example for data intelligence is to build a dashboard that contains metrics on operational performance to inform decision-making. 

**Data Engineering**: The process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining data architectures, such as databases and data pipelines.

**Data Visualization**: The representation of data in a graphical or pictorial format that enables users to understand complex data sets and identify patterns and trends.

**Geographical Information Systems (GIS)**: A system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present spatial or geographic data.

**Machine Learning**: A subset of artificial intelligence that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computer systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.  

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A field of study that focuses on the interaction between human language and computers, enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language
